<h1>Jupiter mvps Website</h1>

<p>It is a simple website having Angular application as frontend and Spring boot application as backend</p>

<p>as we can see, on the main page we have cards of people, which are stored in a database on the server. The backend code created with Spring boot processes requests from the frontend, accesses the database and returns the list of people</p>

<p>we can also post our own person by filling out the form on the add new button. After clicking the submit button, the new card will appear as soon as we return to the main page</p>
