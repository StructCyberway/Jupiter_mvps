# 🌌 Jupiter MVPS Website: Where Angular Meets Spring Boot! 🚀

Welcome to the **Jupiter MVPS Website** – a sleek, modern web application that combines the power of **Angular** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend. This project is more than just a website; it's a dynamic platform that showcases how technology can bring people together! 🌟

## 🖥️ **What's Inside?**

### Frontend: Angular Magic ✨
- **Interactive UI**: A beautifully designed frontend built with Angular, offering a seamless user experience.
- **Dynamic Cards**: Displaying a list of people fetched from the backend, each card is a window into someone's story.

### Backend: Spring Boot Power 💪
- **Robust API**: A Spring Boot backend that handles requests, processes data, and communicates with the database.
- **Database Integration**: Stores and retrieves people's information, ensuring data persistence and reliability.

## 🎨 **Features That Shine**

### 1. **People Cards Gallery** 🃏
On the main page, you'll find a collection of **people cards**, each representing a unique individual stored in the database. These cards are dynamically generated, making the page lively and engaging.

## 🛠️ **How It Works**

1. **Frontend Request**: The Angular frontend sends a request to the Spring Boot backend to fetch the list of people.
2. **Backend Processing**: The Spring Boot application processes the request, accesses the database, and retrieves the data.
3. **Data Display**: The fetched data is sent back to the frontend, where it is displayed as interactive cards.
4. **Add New Entry**: When a new person is added via the form, the data is sent to the backend, stored in the database, and the updated list is fetched and displayed.
